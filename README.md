# Welcome to mod2_project üëã

> A small scale fullstack products page/web store to demonstrate the use of html/css/javaScript for frontend development and node.js/express.js/mongoDB for backend development. There are pages to display products from a database as a whole or a single item. In the single item page you can purchase/delete/update/search products on the frontend that will update the mongoDB database. There also is a page to add new items to the store and mongoDB as needed that will be displayed on the frontend.
